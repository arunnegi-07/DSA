## Problems : Reverse  a Stack (Medium)
You are given a stack **St**. You have to reverse the stack using **recursion**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
St = {3,2,1,7,6}

Output:
{6,7,1,2,3}

Explanation:
Input stack after reversing will look like the stack in the output.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
St = {4,3,9,6}

Output:
{6,9,3,4}

Explanation:
Input stack after reversing will look like the stack in the output.
```

**Your Task:**
```
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Reverse() 
which takes the stack St as input and reverses the given stack.
```

**Expected Time Complexity:** ```O(N)```<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** ```O(N)```

**Constraints:**
<li>1 <= <b>size of the stack</b> <= 10<sup>4</sup></li>
<li>10<sup>-9</sup> <= <b>Each element of the stack</b> <= 10<sup>9</sup></li>
<li>Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceeds 10<sup>6</sup></li>
<li>Array may contain duplicate elements. </li>

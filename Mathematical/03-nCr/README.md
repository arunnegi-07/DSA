## Problem : nCr (Medium)
Given two integers **n** and **r**, find **nCr**. Since the answer may be very large, calculate the answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
n = 3, r = 2

Output: 3

Explaination: 3C2 = 3. 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
n = 2, r = 4

Output: 0

Explaination: r is greater than n.
```

**Your Task:**
```
You do not need to take input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function nCr() which takes n and r as input 
parameters and returns nCr modulo 109+7.
```

**Expected Time Complexity:** ```O(n*r)```<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** ```O(r)```

**Constraints:**
<li>1 ≤ <b>n</b> ≤ 1000</li>
<li>1 ≤ <b>r</b> ≤ 800</li>
